# ImageNet_CNN_Keras_

A computer vision project that predicts the image of cats and dogs. In this project, we tried to improve the accuracy of the model by using three different techniques such as Data augmentation techniques, using a pretrained model, and picking a pretrained model from MobileNetV2.
Initial data gave an accuracy of 70%, and after using our pretrained MobileNetV2 model, we achieved a higher accuracy score of 98%. the model file is saved as ".h5".
